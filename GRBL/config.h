// Specifies the number of work coordinate systems grbl will support (G54 - G59).

#define N_COORDINATE_SYSTEM 1

// This parameter sets the delay time before disabling the steppers after the final block of movement.
// A short delay ensures the steppers come to a complete stop and the residual inertial force in the
// CNC axes don't cause the axes to drift off position. This is particularly important when manually
// entering g-code into grbl, i.e. locating part zero or simple manual machining. If the axes drift,
// grbl has no way to know this has happened, since stepper motors are open-loop control. Depending
// on the machine, this parameter may need to be larger or smaller than the default time.
// NOTE: If commented out, the delay will not be compiled.
#define STEPPER_IDLE_LOCK_TIME 25 // (milliseconds) - Integer > 0

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. Higher number give smoother
// acceleration but may impact performance.
// NOTE: Increasing this parameter will help any resolution related issues, especially with machines
// requiring very high accelerations and/or very fast feedrates. In general, this will reduce the
// error between how the planner plans the motions and how the stepper program actually performs them.
// However, at some point, the resolution can be high enough, where the errors related to numerical
// round-off can be great enough to cause problems and/or it's too fast for the Arduino. The correct
// value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to set this only as high as needed.
// Approximate successful values can range from 30L to 100L or more.
#define ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND 50L

// Minimum planner junction speed. Sets the default minimum speed the planner plans for at the end
// of the buffer and all stops. This should not be much greater than zero and should only be changed
// if unwanted behavior is observed on a user's machine when running at very slow speeds.
#define MINIMUM_PLANNER_SPEED 0.0 // (mm/min)

// Minimum stepper rate. Sets the absolute minimum stepper rate in the stepper program and never runs
// slower than this value, except when sleeping. This parameter overrides the minimum planner speed.
// This is primarily used to guarantee that the end of a movement is always reached and not stop to
// never reach its target. This parameter should always be greater than zero.
#define MINIMUM_STEPS_PER_MINUTE 800 // (steps/min) - Integer value only

// Number of arc generation iterations by small angle approximation before exact arc trajectory
// correction. This parameter maybe decreased if there are issues with the accuracy of the arc
// generations. In general, the default value is more than enough for the intended CNC applications
// of grbl, and should be on the order or greater than the size of the buffer to help with the
// computational efficiency of generating arcs.
#define N_ARC_CORRECTION 25 // Integer (1-255)

// Time delay increments performed during a dwell. The default value is set at 50ms, which provides
// a maximum time delay of roughly 55 minutes, more than enough for most any application. Increasing
// this delay will increase the maximum dwell time linearly, but also reduces the responsiveness of
// run-time command executions, like status reports, since these are performed between each dwell
// time step. Also, keep in mind that the Arduino delay timer is not very accurate for long delays.
#define DWELL_TIME_STEP 50 // Integer (1-255) (milliseconds)

// FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY: Toggles XON/XOFF software flow control for serial communications.
// Officially not supported due to problems involving the Atmega8U2 USB-to-serial chips on all
// new and future Arduinos. The firmware on these chips do not support XON/XOFF flow control
// characters and the intermediate buffer in the chips cause latency and overflow problems with
// standard terminal programs. However, using specifically-programmed UI's to manage this latency
// problem has been confirmed to work, as well as, using older FTDI FT232RL-based Arduinos
// (Duemilanove) since their firmaware correctly manage the XON/XOFF characters. Other unconfirmed
// methods include using an FTDI board/cable or directly communicate on the RX/TX pins on the
// Arduino, both of which circumvent the Atmega8U2 chip altogether. In any case, please report any
// successes to grbl administrators!
